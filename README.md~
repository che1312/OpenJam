#OpenJam
 
OSU Hackathon 2015 Repository
November 14th-15th

/-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/

The purpose of this project was to create an android app that allowed musicians to search for other musicians in their area that they might like to play with. The app is modelled off of Tinder's format.

The end goal for this project is to create an app that:
	- Searches within a user-definable distance from their location.

	- Serves as a platform for musicians to upload pictures and brief videos of them playing.

	- Allows a musician to discuss the genres they play, their favorite artists, skill level, and 		the equipment they own.

	- Contains a short bio that musicians can talk about their personality and other interests.

	- Links to other social media including twitter, Facebook, tumblr, Bandcamp, or Soundcloud.

	- Has a private messagin system between matched musicians.

	- Has a list of upcoming shows on the musician's profile.

As of the date of writing, it is not complete.
